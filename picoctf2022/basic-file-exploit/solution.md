# Basic File Exploit

`data_read` has a check:

``` c
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }
```

So it suffices to pass in data that will cause `strtol` to return `0` (e.g.
`"0"`). Fun fact, `strtol` returning `0` when no conversion is performed is
implementation defined:

> The implementation may also set errno to EINVAL in case no conversion was
> performed (no digits seen, and 0 returned).
